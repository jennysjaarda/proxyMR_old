## Rationale 

- It is well known that mating pairs tend to be phenotypically correlated (e.g. BMI, height, intelligence).
- This observation can partially be explained by assortative mating.
- However it is unknown how this effect changes with age (e.g. stronger/weaker effect of assortative mating older individuals).
- It is also unknown if this correlation is partially due to convergence over time (i.e. amount of time couple is together).

## Methods 

- Determine the sex and age (time together and mean age) specific effects of assortative mating
