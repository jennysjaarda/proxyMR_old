## Message from disk.frame:
We have 1 workers to use with disk.frame.
To change that, use setup_disk.frame(workers = n) or just setup_disk.frame() to use the defaults.


It is recommended that you run the following immediately to set up disk.frame with multiple workers in order to parallelize your operations:


```r
# this will set up disk.frame with multiple workers
setup_disk.frame()
# this will allow unlimited amount of data to be passed from worker to worker
options(future.globals.maxSize = Inf)
```
